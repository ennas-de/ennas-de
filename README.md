## Hi, I’m Abdulhakeem.

Building the future of AI — from foundational theory to production-ready systems — while contributing to open source and advancing developer tools.

### What I work on
- Artificial Intelligence & Agentic Systems: LLM integrations, intelligent agents, pipelines, and AI production infrastructure
- Low-level & Systems Programming: C, C++, memory-efficient algorithms, and high-performance computing
- Blockchain & Decentralized Systems: Infrastructure, SDKs, and integration layers
- Full-Stack & Developer Tooling: Node.js, TypeScript, backend services, APIs, and libraries
- Developer tools and libraries

### Open Source
- I contribute to meaningful projects with a focus on AI, Blockchain, infrastructure, and clean code
- I care about clean code, strong typing, and maintainability
- I prefer small, well-scoped changes that ship fast

### Background
I’ve spent several years building production systems that combine:
- AI-driven products & Data pipelines 
- Full-stack web platforms
- Blockchain & decentralized systems

This experience informs my approach to designing robust, efficient, and scalable solutions, whether contributing to open source or building production AI systems like Atlas AI.
