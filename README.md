## Hi, I’m Abdulhakeem 👋

JavaScript / TypeScript Engineer focused on building and maintaining reliable, scalable systems.

### What I work on
- Node.js & TypeScript tooling
- Backend services & APIs
- Developer tools and libraries
- Blockchain infrastructure & SDKs
- AI / data-driven systems (LLM integrations, pipelines)

### Open Source
- I contribute bug fixes, improvements, and refactors to active JS/TS projects
- I care about clean code, strong typing, and maintainability
- I prefer small, well-scoped changes that ship fast

### Background
I’ve spent several years building production systems for startups and businesses, working across:
- Web platforms
- Blockchain systems
- Data pipelines & AI-driven products

This experience helps me reason about systems, edge cases, and long-term maintainability when contributing to open source.
